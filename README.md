## 🌟 What's New?

My old portfolio was made when I was just starting out. I created every section as a separate HTML file and linked them using buttons — it worked, but wasn't efficient.

Now, I’ve redesigned everything from scratch using cleaner, more modern code. The new version reflects my current skill level and understanding of web development.
